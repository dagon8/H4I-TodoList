# H4I-TodoList
This was the first time I delve into the backend of an app. I was exciting as much as it was intimidating. 
I used the MERN stack to complete this project, which was also new to me. It was challenging due to the little knowledge I had, but youtube helped me along.
With the basic knowledge I had in React, I learned about Axios, requests, useState, useEffect, and much more!
I felt comfortable with the HTML (JSX) and CSS in this project, so I think the frontend is acceptable.
In the end, the project is a simple to-do list with the capabilities of creating, reading, updating, and deleting. (CRUD)

# To Initialize
In the terminal, cd to the server folder and type "node index.js" to start the server.
In another terminal, cd to the client folder and type "npm start" to start the app.

# Looking Back
I think the frontend could look better.
For example, adding box shadows might add more dimension to the website instead of looking too flat.
Another changes I would like to implement would be a done option. Instead of deleting the todo, having a checkmark button that underlines it.
This would give the user the access to still be able to see what they have completed from the list rather than simply deleting it.
A filtering system would go well with the previous suggestion. An option tag that lets you select which todos to display (those completed or those that aren't).
Both the done button and the filtering system are something I have implemented in the past when I created a todo list purely with javascript.
I didn't get to add those aspects due to a lack of time and knowledge, but I will try to add them soon.
Lastly, I still don't feel comfortable with the backend but this was a nice stepping stone to understanding it.
